// this is what you would do if you liked things to be easy:
// var stringifyJSON = JSON.stringify;

// but you don't so you're going to write it from scratch:

var stringifyJSON = function(obj) {
  // move from outside data type to inside
  //update input for next iteration
  //add strigified part to output
  //if it's a number
  	//number.toString
  //if it's null
  	//'null'
  //if boolean
  	//bool.toString
  //if string
  	//return string
  //if array
  	//add [] around 
  	//and loop through each element
  //if object
  	//add {} around
  	//and loop through each key				 	
};
